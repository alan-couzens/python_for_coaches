# python_for_coaches

Repository for the code accompanying my blog series introducing Python to coaches and sport scientists.

You can download the code from the main repo page to wherever your files are & run it on your own machine by going to the command line and typing "python " followed by the name of the file you're running e.g. "python get_fit_file_data.py"
